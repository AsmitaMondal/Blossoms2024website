## Purpose 🤓
The Blossoms School of Sciences website served as an accessible online platform providing comprehensive details for the event titled "Be The Best." The website included vital information such as event rules, dates, venues, timings, in-charge details, a gallery, and an exhibition of the overall theme.

## Technologies Used 👩‍💻
### Scripting Language 📜
JavaScript: Employed for dynamic functionalities, JavaScript enhanced user interaction through features such as alerts, pop-ups, scroll effects, and countdowns, providing a more engaging and interactive user experience.

### Markup Language ❇️
HTML: Utilized for content organization and structure, HTML ensured a clear and logical presentation of information, contributing to an effective user interface and seamless navigation on the Blossoms School of Sciences website.

### Styling ✨
- **Vanilla CSS**: Chosen for styling to ensure a customized and visually appealing design. Vanilla CSS allowed for precise control over the website's aesthetics, providing a cohesive and unique look tailored to the Blossoms School of Sciences event.
- **Canva**: In the realm of styling, the event posters featured on the website, as well as other graphics, were meticulously designed in-house using the versatile design tool, Canva. This personalized touch ensured that the visual elements seamlessly integrated with the overall theme and branding of the Blossoms School of Sciences event.
- **Google Fonts**: This was used to add more personality to the displayed fonts on the website that match with the vibe of the pages.
- **FontAwesome Icons**: The tiny details of icons brought forth the playfulness and meaning of information displayed.

## Design Approach 🎊🥸

- **No Predefined App Used:**
Notably, the website was crafted entirely from scratch, devoid of any pre-designed styles or templates. This bespoke approach allowed for a unique and tailored design, aligning with the specific requirements and aesthetics of the Blossoms School of Sciences event.

- **Responsiveness:**
The website exhibits responsiveness across various screen resolutions, accommodating laptops including those with resolutions ranging from 1366x768, iPads, and mobile phones with a minimum resolution of 768 pixels. Achieving this responsiveness was made possible through the implementation of the @media feature in CSS.

- **Color Palette:** 🖌️ 🟡
While Blossoms traditionally lean towards pink and purple hues, the website takes artistic liberty by incorporating thematic representations of flora through blue, orange, and yellow with a dominant WHITE background (which is luckily the theme color for the School of Sciences-ONYX). The overall style was water-color based. These colors harmonize well, with blue symbolizing tranquility, orange representing energy, and yellow embodying vibrancy. This creative color palette adds a refreshing and distinct visual appeal to the website.

- **Deployment Platform and Monitoring:** 💻
The website was deployed using GitHub Pages, leveraging the capabilities of this platform for hosting static websites. 
A dedicated repository named "BLOSSOMSSOS2024" was created on GitHub. Within this repository, 26 web pages, along with their corresponding 100+ images and videos, were uploaded. 
This deployment required the continuous editing and coding on the Github platform itself while clicking on ‘Commit’ to save all changes so that they can reflect on the main pages. 
Afterward, a custom domain was established, and the final rendering was deployed, providing a universal link for students to easily access the platform.
To maintain real-time updates, GitHub commits were made and monitored every 24 hours.

- **Effects:** 🎇
A marquee feature had been integrated, presenting a scrolling text across the website, informing participants that the website is their ultimate launchpad to success. Users were encouraged to regularly visit the website for all updates. The HTML scroll behavior feature was implemented to ensure a smooth scrolling experience through all sections of the webpage, enhancing overall user navigation and engagement.
Since the website was primarily designed keeping in mind the resolution of laptops, an alert message was displayed on smaller width screens that said that the website usage provides a better experience when opened on laptops and desktops. However, that did not compromise with the way it showed up in smaller screens.
